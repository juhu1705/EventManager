## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities please create an Issue in this repository.

Please use the template to report a bug and descripe the vulnerability as detailed as you can. 
I will look up the issue when I have time next. It could be that I have further questions, so please look up one time a week.
As this is only a hobby project I cannot savely secure that I can update this security issue, but I try my very best.
If I accept the vulnerability I am on the way to fix it.

If I decline the vulnerability I may not have enough time to fix it or will not fix it.

In every case I am very happy of helping hands. So you are allowed to make pull requests where you fixed or start to fixed these issues and I will if they are enhancments commit them.
